#Observable Trends in data
Throughout the clinical trial period, Capomulin had an observable reduction effect on the tumor volume as evidenced by the scatter plots  and final bar chart which resulted to fewer spread of metastatic sites as well as a higher survival rate in the mice that were    administered the drug.

Ketrapil on the other hand showed to have a very negative effect on tumor reduction and had the highest percentage of tumor growth in mice  compared to the three other drugs under observation (Capomulin, Infubinol and Placebo).

Another observation from the displayed results is that mice given the drug Infubinol had the lowest survival rates and had a tumor volume similar to that of Ketrapil and Placebo
